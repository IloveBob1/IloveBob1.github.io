# ShapezJS

ShapezJS is a JavaScript recreation of the popular game [shapez.io](https://shapez.io) by Tobias Springer (also known as tobspr). This project aims to replicate the core mechanics of shapez.io using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, where players automate the production of various shapes using a range of tools and components.
